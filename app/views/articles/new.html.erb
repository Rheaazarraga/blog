<h1>New Article</h1>

<%= form_for :article do |f| %>
  <p>
  <%= f.label :title %><br>
  <%= f.text_area :text %>
  </p>

  <p>
  <%= f.submit %>
  </p>
<% end %>

# When form_for is called, it needs to be passed an identifying object for the form. In this case, it's the symbol :article. This tells the form_for helper what this form is for.

# Inside the block for this method, the FormBuilder object - represented by f - is used to build two labels and two text fields, one each for the title and text of an article. 

# Finally, a call to submit on the f object will create a submit button for the form.
